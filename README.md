## Setup — 1 message, all in Claude Code

You don't need a terminal. Just open Claude Code and paste this:

> *Set me up for the Fractal AI Workshop. The repo is at github.com/Mattyreed1/fractal-ai-workshop-ea-starter. Clone it and walk me through the setup.*

Claude Code will:

1. Clone this repo to `~/fractal-ai-workshop-ea-starter`
2. Install 3 skills into `~/.claude/skills/`
3. Ask you for your **n8n URL + API key** (walks you through where to find them)
4. Ask you for your **Notion integration token** (walks you through creating one)
5. Wire both MCP servers
6. Create your personalized `CLAUDE.md`
7. Tell you to quit + reopen Claude Code

Total: ~15 minutes. No terminal commands.

After restart, paste:

> *Check my setup*

Confirms everything is wired.

## What's inside

| Skill | What it does |
|-------|--------------|
| **`n8n`** | Master skill + 8 sub-skills covering nodes, expressions, code, validation, and template publishing. Lets your CC build n8n workflows by talking. |
| **`notion`** | Read/write Notion pages and databases. Search, query, create, update, append. |
| **`openclaw-vps-setup`** | Provisions a Hetzner VPS, installs OpenClaw in Docker, sets up the 4-Layer Agent Architecture, deploys agents into Discord channels. The take-home from Workshop Build #2. |
| **`claude-code-setup`** | The setup wizard above — walks Claude Code through installing the other skills + wiring the MCP servers. |

## How to use it after setup

```
You: build an n8n workflow that takes incoming RFIs from a webhook and posts a summary to my Notion project DB
Claude Code: [reads the n8n + notion skills, designs the workflow, builds it via MCP, tests, confirms]
```

```
You: set up my VPS and onboard an RFI triage agent
Claude Code: [reads openclaw-vps-setup skill, walks through provisioning, installs OpenClaw, deploys the agent]
```

```
You: save today's meeting notes to my Notion in the project page for Acme
Claude Code: [searches Notion, finds the page, appends formatted notes]
```

## The 90-day plan

After the workshop, see [`docs/90-day-plan.md`](docs/90-day-plan.md):

- **Week 1:** One real task automated, your VPS running, one agent online
- **Month 1:** 2-3 more agents onboarded, shared memory layer in regular use
- **Quarter 1:** Walk into your next role with a working agent team

---

## Already a power user?

If you prefer terminal:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Mattyreed1/fractal-ai-workshop-ea-starter.git ~/fractal-ai-workshop-ea-starter
cd ~/fractal-ai-workshop-ea-starter
bash install.sh
```

Then wire the MCP servers manually per `claude-skills/claude-code-setup/SKILL.md` Steps 4-5, and restart Claude Code.

The Claude Code wizard path above handles all of this automatically.
